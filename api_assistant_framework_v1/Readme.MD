Ah, I see! You're asking for how to make API calls to the Petstore Swagger API using `curl`.

Here are a few examples of how you can interact with the Petstore API using `curl`.

### 1. **Get Swagger JSON** (this is just to retrieve the API definition):
```bash
curl https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json
```

### 2. **Get List of Pets** (GET request to retrieve all pets):
```bash
curl -X GET "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available" -H "accept: application/json"
```
This will retrieve a list of available pets.

### 3. **Add a New Pet** (POST request to add a pet to the store):
```bash
curl -X POST "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "id": 0,
  "category": {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "string"
  },
  "name": "Doggie",
  "photoUrls": [
    "string"
  ],
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "string"
    }
  ],
  "status": "available"
}'
```
This sends a POST request to add a new pet (with basic information like name, category, and status).

### 4. **Get a Specific Pet by ID** (GET request to retrieve a pet by its ID):
```bash
curl -X GET "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/1" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Replace `1` with the ID of the pet you want to get.

### 5. **Update Pet Information** (PUT request to update an existing pet):
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "id": 1,
  "category": {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "string"
  },
  "name": "UpdatedDoggie",
  "photoUrls": [
    "string"
  ],
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "string"
    }
  ],
  "status": "sold"
}'
```
This sends a PUT request to update the pet with ID `1`.

### 6. **Delete a Pet** (DELETE request to remove a pet by ID):
```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/1" -H "accept: application/json"
```
This will delete the pet with ID `1` from the store.
